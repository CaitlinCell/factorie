Pre 1.0 release:

Implement sparse iteration through values for BP [McCallum]
Consider renaming LabelVariable to LabeledCategoricalVariable, and having LabeledDiscreteVariable, LabeledBooleanVariable [McCallum]
Fix Family's serialization of DiscreteDomains and CategoricalDomains.  Make user serialize separately from Model.
Make DotFamily can depend on just TensorVar, not DiscreteTensorVar.
Rename DiscreteTensorVar to DiscreteDomainTensorVar for clarity; similarly for Categorical. [McCallum]
DomainFromClass or make it the default?  [McCallum]
Finish app.classify.Classifier command-line tool [McCallum, Vilnis]
Consider property-like facilities and its interaction with command line [McCallum, Vilnis]
 No, use scala interpreter itself for configuration as recommended online.
Make app.regress  [McCallum, Passos]
Finish BP.  Make it fast!  [Martin, Pandya, Singh]
Wrap-up and clean up NER and POS [Anzaroot]
Consider changes to generative.Collapse infrastructure  [McCallum]
Implement generative.CollapsedVariationalBayes and make sure it works for LDA  [McCallum]
Re-consider type arguments in Sampler and descendants  [McCallum]
Look at app.nlp.relation  [McCallum]
Make a command-line tool similar to Mallet SimpleTagger [McCallum]
Look at other BUGS-like tools, and see what we can reproduce easily [Bakalov, Duckworth]
Make reasonable command-line tools for MALLET functionality, and document [McCallum and others]
Sanity-check pass through all code [All]
Consider which println's should be transformed into Logging statements
Package documentation  [All]
Fix copyright year [McCallum]
Write JUnit tests for cc.factorie.la [Vilnis?]

More examples:
Tutorial examples [McCallum]
Basic models [All]
Implement TopicsOverTime (needs Beta distribution) [Bakalov]
Make an HMM example and show that BP inference and EM training work on it [Belanger]


DONE:
Remove er package altogether for now [McCallum]
Remove statisticsDomain and let DotFamily.weights be abstract  [McCallum]  
Make BooleanValue be a class rather than (as it is currently) a type alias for CategoricalValue[Boolean] [McCallum]
Use _1, _2 again for the variables in AbstractAssignment2, etc.  Use value1, value2 for values. [McCallum]
Rename all "Stat" to "Statistics". [McCallum]
Finish/fix DecisionTree implementation, and make example
Remove Factor.Values
Make RealVar inherit from TensorVar (with DoubleVar replacing current one)
Make a Family.score(Tensor) method for use in higher efficiency situations (e.g. BP)
Consider moving generative.GibbsSampler up to cc.factorie?
Consider making no variable inherit from Iterable.  (Seq would come from value instead.)  Remove SeqEqualsEq and friends.
 Consider making any current Variable that *could* have more than one different value type be not a Variable.  
 Then allow Model.factors and Infer and Maximize to have apply(Iterable[Variable]) and Apply(Variable).
 Then, e.g. change "for (token <- document)" to "for (token <- document.tokens)". [done]
Re-consider if variable.value should always make an immutable copy.  [no]
Look at Gaussian.logpr, Beta.logpr, etc, and ensure these scores are correct.  [yes]
Get rid of Seq[Double] everywhere, including cc.factorie.maths.  Get rid of IndexedSeqOps completely.
Get rid of la.Vector and use la.Tensor instead.  Make corresponding changes in Factors/Templates, etc.
Make VectorFamily require "def statisticsDomain"
Consider making cc.factorie.optimize take DoubleSeq instead of Array[Double]
Get AROW Perceptron training working, and look at SampleRank interaction
Get rid of dependency on Java bibtex parser library
Implement parameter averaging

Future:
Sebastian: Make new kinds of Templates; current one: factors(Variable neighbor); new: factors(arbitrary context)
 Consider naming the current Template something more specific, e.g. "NeighborTemplate"
 Template[C] { def factors(context:C): Iterable[Factors] }
 NeighborTemplate extends Template[Variable] { def unroll1(v:Variable): Iterable[Factors] }




Low Priority Coding:
Replace cc.factorie.er with something better that uses Scala 2.10 macros.
-Implement Forany2 in er
-Fix IntTerm in er
-Support inference over relations in er
Create simple infrastructure for non-relational generative Bayes nets

Testing:
Create more unit tests!
Profile everything, especially BP and LDA.

Documentation:
Clean up all examples
Put in ACE coref example
Put in final spanner example
Write manual in package.html
Document how to get a FACTORIE interpreter prompt
