Coding:
Finish belief propagation message-passing 
Re-consider type arguments in Sampler and descendants
Implement VariationalBayes

Low Priority Coding:
Implement Forany2 in er
Fix IntTerm in er
Support inference over relations in er
Create simple infrastructure for non-relational generative Bayes nets

Testing:
Create more unit tests!
Why does LDA get much slower when you tell the sampler not to create DiffLists.  I expected the opposite! 
Profile everything, especially BP and LDA.

Documentation:
Clean up all examples
Put in ACE coref example
Put in final spanner example
Create a Gaussian mixture example
Write README.txt
Write manual in package.html
Document how to get a factorie interpretter prompt
