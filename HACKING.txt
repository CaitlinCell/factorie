Development
===========

For Eclipse - Currently only working with Eclipse version 3.5.2

Increase Eclipse available memory:
 See--http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm
 On Mac:
  Close Eclipse if open
  Right click on application icon, select "Show Package Contents"
  Open Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini
  Change -Xmx256m to -Xmx1024m, save file and open Eclipse

Factorie branch "0.9" and higher uses Scala 2.8
Install Eclipse Maven plugin:
 Within Eclipse, select menu "Help" -> "Install New Software"
 Enter this URL:  http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e
 Click check box and install
 Relaunch Eclipse

Install Eclipse Scala plugin:
 Within Eclipse, select menu "Help" -> "Install New Software"
 Enter this URL: http://download.scala-ide.org/update-current-35
 Click all check boxes and install
 Relaunch Eclipse

Import Factorie, (assuming that it has already been checked out to "~/workspace/factorie"):
 Within Eclipse, select menu "File" -> "New" -> "Scala Project"
 In dialog box, select "Create project from existing source"
 Browse to enter your factorie directory (e.g. "~/workspace/factorie")
 Click "Next"
 Right click on "factorie" in "Package explorer" to left, 
  select menu "M2 Maven" -> "Enable Dependency Management"
Wait for it to compile - could take a very long time


For IntelliJ

Works with IntelliJ "community edition" out of the box.
