Pre 1.0 release:

Remove statisticsDomain and just get size
DomainFromClass or make it the default.
Remove Factor.Values
Make app.regress and consider making RealVar inherit from TensorVar (with DoubleVar replacing current one)
Finish BP and move to cc.factorie package.  Make it fast!
Consider changes to generative.Collapse infrastructure
Implement generative.CollapsedVariationalBayes and make sure it works for LDA
Re-consider type arguments in Sampler and descendants
Look at app.nlp.relation
Make reasonable command-line tools for MALLET functionality, and document
Sanity-check pass through all code
Package documentation

More examples:
Implement TopicsOverTime (needs Beta distribution)
Finish/fix DecisionTree implementation, and make example
Make an HMM example and show that BP inference and EM training work on it


DONE:
Make a Family.score(Tensor) method for use in higher efficiency situations (e.g. BP)
Consider moving generative.GibbsSampler up to cc.factorie?
Consider making no variable inherit from Iterable.  (Seq would come from value instead.)  Remove SeqEqualsEq and friends.
 Consider making any current Variable that *could* have more than one different value type be not a Variable.  
 Then allow Model.factors and Infer and Maximize to have apply(Iterable[Variable]) and Apply(Variable).
 Then, e.g. change "for (token <- document)" to "for (token <- document.tokens)". [done]
Re-consider if variable.value should always make an immutable copy.  [no]
Look at Gaussian.logpr, Beta.logpr, etc, and ensure these scores are correct.  [yes]
Get rid of Seq[Double] everywhere, including cc.factorie.maths.  Get rid of IndexedSeqOps completely.
Get rid of la.Vector and use la.Tensor instead.  Make corresponding changes in Factors/Templates, etc.
Make VectorFamily require "def statisticsDomain"
Consider making cc.factorie.optimize take DoubleSeq instead of Array[Double]
Get AROW Perceptron training working, and look at SampleRank interaction
Get rid of dependency on Java bibtex parser library
Implement parameter averaging

Future:
Sebastian: Make new kinds of Templates; current one: factors(Variable neighbor); new: factors(arbitrary context)
 Consider naming the current Template something more specific, e.g. "NeighborTemplate"
 Template[C] { def factors(context:C): Iterable[Factors] }
 NeighborTemplate extends Template[Variable] { def unroll1(v:Variable): Iterable[Factors] }




Low Priority Coding:
Replace cc.factorie.er with something better that uses Scala 2.10 macros.
-Implement Forany2 in er
-Fix IntTerm in er
-Support inference over relations in er
Create simple infrastructure for non-relational generative Bayes nets

Testing:
Create more unit tests!
Profile everything, especially BP and LDA.

Documentation:
Clean up all examples
Put in ACE coref example
Put in final spanner example
Write manual in package.html
Document how to get a FACTORIE interpreter prompt
