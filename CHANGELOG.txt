New in Version 0.9.0:

Rudimentary optimize package includes ConjugateGradient and
LimitedMemoryBFGS.

LogLinearMaximumLikelihood sets parameters by BFGS on likelihood
gradient calculated by belief propagation on trees.  Additional
inference methods to come soon.

Belief propagation now works.

Variables no longer use their own "set" method to initialize their
values.  This means that if you are relying on "override def set" to
do some coordination during object initialization, you must separately
set up this coordination in your own constructors.

Rename Factor neighbor variables from "n1" to "_1" to better match
Scala's Tuples.

Support for generative models has been completely overhauled, and is
now in its own separate package: cc.factorie.generative.

Many variables have been renamed to better match standard names in
statistics, including EnumVariable => CategoricalVariable.
